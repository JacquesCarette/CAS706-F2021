# CAS706-F2021
Repository for Fall 2021 version of CAS 706

This is based on [PLFA](https://github.com/plfa/plfa.github.io) and borrows substantially from [Prabhakar Ragde's](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/) course [CS 747](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/747/) which is an 'instance' of PLFA.

You will find
- in `CS747`, the original handout files for that course
- in `handout`, the slightly modified files used for CAS 706
- in filled, what we ended up doing during lectures

More material will get posted here as it arises. Such as what was covered in the lectures, the 
extra material used, the assignments, etc.
