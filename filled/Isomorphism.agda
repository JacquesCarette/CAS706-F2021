fromb : Bin-ℕ → ℕ
fromb n = {!!}

-- The reason that we couldn't prove ∀ {n : Bin-ℕ} → tob (fromb n) ≡ n
-- is because of the possibility of leading zeroes in a Bin-ℕ value.
-- 'bits x0 x0 x1' is such a value that gives a counterexample.
-- However, the theorem is true is true for n without leading zeroes.
-- We define a predicate to be able to state this in a theorem.
-- A value of type One n is evidence that n has a leading one.

data One : Bin-ℕ → Set where
  [bitsx1] : One (bits x1)
  _[x0] : ∀ {n : Bin-ℕ} → One n → One (n x0)
  _[x1] : ∀ {n : Bin-ℕ} → One n → One (n x1)

-- Here's a proof that 'bits x1 x0 x0' has a leading one.

_ : One (bits x1 x0 x0)
_ = [bitsx1] [x0] [x0]

-- There is no value of type One (bits x0 x0 x1).
-- But we can't state and prove this yet, because we don't know
-- how to express negation. That comes in the Connectives chapter.

-- A canonical binary representation is either zero or has a leading one.

data Can : Bin-ℕ → Set where
  [zero] : Can bits
  [pos]  : ∀ {n : Bin-ℕ} → One n → Can n

-- Some obvious examples:

_ = [pos] ([bitsx1] [x0])

-- The Bin-predicates exercise in PLFA Relations gives three properties of canonicity.
-- The first is that the increment of a canonical number is canonical.

-- Most of the work is done in the following lemma.

-- 747/PLFA exercise: IncCanOne (2 points)
-- The increment of a canonical number has a leading one.

one-inc : ∀ {n : Bin-ℕ} → Can n → One (inc n)

-- 747/PLFA exercise: OneInc (1 point)

can-inc : ∀ {n : Bin-ℕ} → Can n → Can (inc n)
can-inc cn = {!!}

-- The second canonicity property is that converting a unary number
-- to binary produces a canonical number.

-- 747/PLFA exercise: CanToB (1 point)

to-can : ∀ (n : ℕ) → Can (tob n)
to-can n = {!!}

-- The third canonicity property is that converting a canonical number
-- from binary and back to unary produces the same number.

-- This takes more work, and some helper lemmas from 747Induction.
-- You will need to discover which ones.

-- 747/PLFA exercise: OneDblbX0 (1 point)

-- This helper function relates binary double to the x0 constructor,
-- for numbers with a leading one.

-- Do we have an isomorphism between ℕ (unary) and canonical binary representations?
-- Can is not a set, but a family of sets, so it doesn't quite fit
-- into our framework for isomorphism.
-- But we can roll all the values into one set which is isomorphic to ℕ.

-- A CanR value wraps up a Bin-ℕ and proof it has a canonical representation.

-- Can we get an isomorphism between ℕ and some binary encoding,
-- without the awkwardness of non-canonical values?
-- Yes: we use digits 1 and 2, instead of 0 and 1 (multiplier/base is still 2).
-- This is known as bijective binary numbering.
-- The counting sequence goes <empty>, 1, 2, 11, 12, 21, 22, 111...
