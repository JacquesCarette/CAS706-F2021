-- Definition of datatype representing natural numbers.
-- Typing ℕ in emacs: "\ b N"  ℕ ℤ ℝ
data ℕ : Set where
  zero : ℕ
  suc  : ℕ → ℕ

-- A couple of definitions using this datatype.

one : ℕ
one = suc zero

two : ℕ
two = suc (suc zero)

two′ : ℕ
two′ = suc one

-- I could have also said two = suc one.

-- PLFA exercise: write out seven.

-- Pragma to use decimal notation as shorthand.

{-# BUILTIN NATURAL ℕ #-}
three : ℕ
three = 3

-- Some useful imports from the standard library:

import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality as Eq
open Eq using (_≡_; refl)
open Eq.≡-Reasoning using (begin_; _≡⟨⟩_; _∎)

-- Addition on naturals.

_+_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ  -- mixfix notation!  Arguments go in the _
zero + n = n
suc m + n = suc (m + n)

-- Agda normalization; proof of equality.

private
  _ : 2 + 3 ≡ 5
  _ = refl

-- Equational reasoning.

_ : 2 + 3 ≡ 5
_ =
  begin
    2 + 3
  ≡⟨⟩    -- is shorthand for -- typed as ≡ (\ = =) ⟨ (\ <) ⟩ (\ >) ≡⟨⟩
        -- ≡⟨⟩ is another form of 'just true' when lhs = rhs is true by definition & computation
    (suc (suc zero)) + (suc (suc (suc zero)))
  ≡⟨⟩    -- many steps condensed
    5
  ∎

-- PLFA shows longhand and shorthand are interchangeable.

-- PLFA exercise: write out the reduction for 3+4 equationally.


-- Multiplication.

_*_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
zero * n = zero
suc m * n = m * n + n -- (m+1) * n = ?????  if we expand m*n + 1*n = m*n + n

_ = begin
  2 * 3  ≡⟨⟩    -- many steps condensed
  6      ∎

-- PLFA exercise: write out 3*4.

-- 747 exercise: Exponentiation (1 point)
-- Define exponentiation (m raised to the power n).
-- 0 ^ 0 = 1 for this exercise.
{-
_^_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
m ^ n = {!!}

-- One test for exponentiation (you should write others).

_ : 2 ^ 3 ≡ 8
_ = refl

-- Monus (subtraction for naturals, bottoms out at zero).
-- ∸ typed as \ . -
_∸_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

-- PLFA exercise: write out 5 ∸ 3 and 3 ∸ 5.

-- Binary representation.
-- Modified from PLFA exercise (thanks to David Darais).

data Bin-ℕ : Set where
  bits : Bin-ℕ
  _x0 : Bin-ℕ → Bin-ℕ
  _x1 : Bin-ℕ → Bin-ℕ

-- Our representation of zero is different from PLFA.
-- We use the empty sequence of bits (more consistent).

bin-zero : Bin-ℕ
bin-zero = bits

bin-one : Bin-ℕ
bin-one = bits x1     -- 1 in binary

bin-two : Bin-ℕ
bin-two = bits x1 x0  -- 10 in binary

-- 747 exercise: Increment (1 point)
-- Define increment (add one).

inc : Bin-ℕ → Bin-ℕ
inc bits = {!!}
inc (m x0) = {!!}
inc (m x1) = {!!}

-- An example/test of increment (you should create others).

_ : inc (bits x1 x0 x1 x1) ≡ bits x1 x1 x0 x0
_ = refl

-- 747 exercise: To/From (2 points)
-- Define 'tob' and 'fromb' operations
-- to convert between unary (ℕ) and binary (Bin-ℕ) notation.
-- Hint: avoid addition and multiplication,
-- and instead use the provided dbl (double) function.
-- This will make later proofs easier.
-- I've put 'b' on the end of the operations to
-- avoid a name clash in a later file.
-- It also makes the direction clear when using them.

dbl : ℕ → ℕ
dbl zero = zero
dbl (suc m) = suc (suc (dbl m))

tob : ℕ → Bin-ℕ
tob m = {!!}

fromb : Bin-ℕ → ℕ
fromb n = {!!}

-- A couple of examples/tests (you should create others).

_ : tob 6 ≡ bits x1 x1 x0
_ = refl

_ : fromb (bits x1 x1 x0) ≡ 6
_ = refl

-- 747 exercise: BinAdd (2 points)
-- Write the addition function for binary notation.
-- Do NOT use 'to' and 'from'. Work with Bin-ℕ as if ℕ did not exist.
-- Hint: use recursion on both m and n.

_bin-+_ : Bin-ℕ → Bin-ℕ → Bin-ℕ
m bin-+ n = {!!}

-- Tests can use to/from, or write out binary constants as below.
-- Again: write more tests!

_ : (bits x1 x0) bin-+ (bits x1 x1) ≡ (bits x1 x0 x1)
_ = refl

-- That's it for now, but we will return to binary notation later.

-- Many definitions from above are also in the standard library.

-- open import Data.Nat using (ℕ; zero; suc; _+_; _*_; _^_; _∸_)
