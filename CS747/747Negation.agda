-- PLFA exercise: one of DeMorgan's Laws as isomorphism
-- ⊎-dual-× : ∀ {A B : Set} → ¬ (A ⊎ B) ≃ (¬ A) × (¬ B)
-- Expand negation as implies-false, then look in 747Relations
-- for a law of which this is a special case.

-- What about ¬ (A × B) ≃ (¬ A) ⊎ (¬ B)?
-- Answer: RHS implies LHS but converse cannot be proved in intuitionistic logic.

-- Intuitionistic vs classical logic.

-- The law of the excluded middle (LEM, or just em) cannot be
-- proved in intuitionistic logic.
-- But we can add it, and get classical logic.

-- postulate
--  em : ∀ {A : Set} → A ⊎ ¬ A

-- How do we know this does not give a contradiction?
-- The following theorem of intuitionistic logic demonstrates this.
-- (The proof is compact, but takes some thought.)

-- PLFA exercise: classical equivalences
-- Excluded middle cannot be proved in intuitionistic logic,
-- but adding it is consistent and gives classical logic.
-- Here are four other classical theorems with the same property.
-- You can show that each of them is logically equivalent to all the others.
-- You do not need to prove twenty implications, since implication is transitive.
-- But there is a lot of choice as to how to proceed!

-- Excluded Middle
em = ∀ {A : Set} → A ⊎ ¬ A

-- Double Negation Elimination
dne = ∀ {A : Set} → ¬ ¬ A → A

-- Peirce’s Law
peirce =  ∀ {A B : Set} → ((A → B) → A) → A

-- Implication as disjunction
iad =  ∀ {A B : Set} → (A → B) → ¬ A ⊎ B

-- De Morgan:
dem = ∀ {A B : Set} → ¬ (¬ A × ¬ B) → A ⊎ B

-- End of classical five exercise.

-- Definition: a formula is stable if double negation holds for it.

Stable : Set → Set
Stable A = ¬ ¬ A → A

-- PLFA exercise: every negated formula is stable.
-- This is triple negation elimination.

-- PLFA exercise: the conjunction of two stable formulas is stable.
-- This is the version of DeMorgan's Law that is a special case, above.

-- Where negation sits in the standard library.
